  <dc:description>Simple Network Management Protocol Open Source library written in c# with support for SNMP version 1, 2c and 3.

Support for Get, Get-Next, Get-Bulk and Set requests, Response and Report replies and Trap, V2Trap and Inform Notifications is implemented. SNMP version 1 Traps have a dedicated packet class SnmpV1TrapPacket because they are substantially different from other SNMP version 1 packets. SNMP version 2 and 3 V2Trap parsing is included in the general request/response parsing class for each protocol. Inform handling for both SNMP version 2 and 3 is included and tested. In version 3, V2Trap and Inform support for authentication and privacy is included.

SNMP version 3 currently support noAuthNoPriv (no privacy and no authentication) security model, authNoPriv using MD5 and SHA-1 authentication and authPriv using, again, MD5 and SHA-1 authentication with DES, AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 and TripleDES privacy encryption.</dc:description>
